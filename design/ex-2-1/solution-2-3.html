            <h2>Geist Font Demonstration</h2>
            <p class="geist-regular">This paragraph uses the Geist font, which is locally installed. Geist is a modern sans-serif typeface designed by Vercel. It's clean, legible, and perfect for both headings and body text.</p>
            <p class="geist-medium">This paragraph also uses Geist, but with a medium weight. Notice how it stands out slightly compared to the regular weight above.</p>

            <h2>Typographic Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>In this section, we'll demonstrate how different font families can be used to create a clear visual hierarchy.</p>
            <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
            <p>This is body text. Notice how the different levels of headings and the body text create a clear structure on the page. This helps guide the reader's eye and makes the content easier to scan and understand.</p>
            <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
            <p>Even within body text, we can create hierarchy. <strong>Bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em> can be used to emphasize certain words or phrases.</p>

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>
            <p class="letter-spacing-demo">This paragraph demonstrates adjusted letter spacing. The increased space between letters can create a distinctive look, but be careful not to reduce readability.</p>
            <p class="word-spacing-demo">This paragraph shows the effect of increased word spacing. This can sometimes improve readability, especially for readers with certain visual impairments.</p>
