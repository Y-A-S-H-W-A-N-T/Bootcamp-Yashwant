# Project: Clinical Trial Data Representation

## Problem Definition
The goal is to build a reusable application to fetch and display clinical trial data for a given disease and provide comprehensive details for a specific trial. The application should allow users to:
- Search for studies by disease name.
- View detailed study information, including display title, NCT ID, status, intervention (drug name), sponsor, target, modality, and MoA.
- Fetch study details for a specific trial ID using provided APIs.
- Search for drugs in the Open Targets (OT) database using a drug annotation API.

## Data Representation Strategy
### Recommended Format: **Table with Filters**

### **Table Format?**
- **Structured and Clear**: Displays information in a well-organized grid, making comparisons easy.
- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles large datasets with scrollable and paginated tables.
- **Customizable**: Columns can be shown, hidden, or reordered based on user preferences.
- **Interactive**: Supports sorting, filtering, and inline actions like hyperlinks.

### **Structure of the Table**
Columns of the table include:
- Study Title (Hyperlinked to detailed view)
- Status (e.g., Recruiting, Completed)
- NCT ID
- Intervention (Drug Name)
- Sponsor
- Target
- Modality
- Mechanism of Action (MoA)

**Example Layout**:
```
| Study Title         | Status     | NCT ID    | Intervention | Sponsor  | Target   | Modality         | MoA        |
|---------------------|------------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|------------------|------------|
| Study A (Hyperlink) | Recruiting | NCT123456 | Drug A       | Sponsor X| Protein Y| Small Molecule   | Inhibitor  |
```

### **Filters for Accurate Information**
The app will include filters to refine search results and display the most relevant studies. 
#### **Filter Options:**
1. **Disease Name**: To fetch studies for a specific disease.
2. **Status**: Filter by recruiting, completed, or terminated studies.
3. **Intervention Type**: Search by drug type (e.g., small molecule, biologic).
4. **Sponsor Name**: Focus on studies by specific organizations.
5. **Target**: Find studies targeting specific proteins or pathways.
6. **Modality**: Filter by the type of intervention (e.g., gene therapy, vaccine).
7. **Date Range**: Specify study start or end dates.

### **Additional Features**
1. **Search Bar**: To quickly locate specific studies by title or NCT ID.
2. **Sorting Options**: Sort studies by relevance, date, or sponsor.
3. **Bookmarking**: Save specific studies for later reference.
4. **Download Option**: Export filtered study data as CSV or JSON.

## Application Workflow
1. **Home Page**: Search bar and filter options to fetch studies.
2. **Results Page**:
   - Display results in a table format.
   - Allow dynamic filtering and sorting.
3. **Study Details Page**:
   - Provide detailed information for a specific trial (via Trial ID).
   - Include hyperlinks to related studies or external sources.
4. **Drug Search Page**:
   - Search for a drug in Open Targets (OT) using the Drug Annotation API.
   - Display results in an intuitive format.

## Exit Criteria
1. Fetch and display studies for a given disease using provided APIs.
2. Implement table-based representation of study data with dynamic filtering.
3. Fetch and display detailed study information for a specific Trial ID.
4. Enable drug search functionality using the Drug Annotation API.
5. Provide reusable components and documentation for future extensions.

## Deliverables
1. **Reusable Component Library**: For tables, filters, and data displays.
2. **API Integration**: Robust API handling for fetching study and drug data.
3. **Interactive User Interface**: Table format with dynamic filters and sorting.
4. **Documentation**: Developer guide for extending and reusing components.
