# Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) UI Development

## Project Overview
The goal is to build a user interface (UI) that visualizes the Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) process, which involves predicting how molecules arrange themselves in a solid (crystalline) state. The UI will consist of three main tabs representing key steps in the CSP workflow: conformer generation, crystal structure generation, and energy prediction.

## General UI Development Considerations

### User Experience (UX)
- Prioritize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface.
- Ensure clear labeling, logical layout, and easy navigation between tabs.

### Data Visualization
- Utilize effective visualization techniques to represent molecular structures, crystal densities, and lattice energies.
- Use appropriate charting libraries for 3D structures, histograms, and scatter plots.

### Responsiveness
- The UI should adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

### Error Handling
- Implement robust mechanisms to handle invalid inputs, API errors, and unexpected situations gracefully.
- Display informative error messages.

### Performance
- Optimize the UI for handling large datasets, employing techniques like pagination or lazy loading as needed.

### Code Maintainability
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.

## Tab-Specific UI Development Details

### Tab 1: 3D Conformer Generation

#### Data Flow
- **Input**: SMILES string (molecular representation).
- **Output**: XYZ or SDF files containing 3D conformer coordinates from the backend API.

#### UI Tasks
- **Input Field**: Create a text input field for the SMILES string, with an optional file upload feature for SMILES files.
- **Visualization Area**: Implement a 3D molecular viewer (e.g., NGL view, 3Dmol.js) with the following features:
  - Rotate, zoom, and pan 3D structures.
  - Select and highlight individual conformers.
  - Display conformer properties if provided by the backend.
- **Conformer Selection**: Provide a selection mechanism (e.g., a list or grid of thumbnails) if multiple conformers are returned.

#### Technical Considerations
- Choose a suitable library for 3D molecular visualization.
- Ensure smooth rendering of potentially complex 3D structures.
- Handle file parsing for XYZ or SDF formats.

### Tab 2: Crystal Structure Generation

#### Data Flow
- **Input**: Selected conformers from Tab 1 or direct input.
- **Output**: Crystal density data from the backend API.

#### UI Tasks
- **Input Fields**: Include fields for:
  - Conformer selection (dropdown or file upload).
  - Crystal generation method (e.g., "Polymorph").
  - Space group (dropdown or text input).
  - Z' (numeric input).
  - Number of crystals to generate (numeric input).
- **Visualization**: Display a histogram to represent the distribution of crystal densities.
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Handle different input types (dropdowns, file uploads, numeric inputs).
  - Efficiently process and visualize large datasets of crystal densities.
  - Use a charting library like Chart.js, Plotly.js, or D3.js for histograms.

### Tab 3: Energy Prediction and Analysis

#### Data Flow
- **Input**: Generated crystal structures from Tab 2.
- **Output**: Predicted lattice energies from the backend API.

#### UI Tasks
- **Data Processing**: Combine crystal density data and predicted lattice energies.
- **Visualization**:
  - Create a scatter plot with crystal density on the x-axis and lattice energy on the y-axis.
  - Display a table of the most stable crystal structures (lowest lattice energies) with details such as names/filenames, rankings, and energy values.
  - Include a 3D molecular viewer for selected stable structures.

#### Technical Considerations
- Ensure data consistency across tabs.
- Implement sorting and filtering for the table display.
- Handle 3D visualization for crystal structures, including unit cell representations.

## API Integration

### API Endpoints
- Obtain documentation for backend APIs used in each tab.

### Data Formats
- Understand data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) for API requests and responses.

### Authentication
- Implement required authentication mechanisms.

### Error Handling
- Provide robust handling for API errors and display user-friendly messages.

## Visualization Libraries and Tools
- **3D Molecular Visualization**: NGL view, 3Dmol.js, Jmol.
- **Charting Libraries**: Chart.js, Plotly.js, D3.js.
- **UI Frameworks**: React, Vue.js, Angular (based on project requirements).

## Development Workflow
1. **API Familiarization**: Understand endpoints, data formats, and authentication.
2. **UI Design**: Plan overall layout and navigation.
3. **Incremental Development**: Develop each tab incrementally, focusing on data flow, input/output, and visualization.
4. **API Integration**: Integrate UI with backend APIs.
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Test for functionality, usability, and performance.
